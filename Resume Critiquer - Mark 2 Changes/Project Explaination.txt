An **AI Resume Critiquer** built with **Python and Streamlit** is essentially a web app where a user can upload a resume and receive **automated feedback** powered by AI. Streamlit handles the **user interface**, while Python scripts manage **file parsing, AI analysis, and report generation**.

---

## **2. Workflow**

### **Step 1: User Uploads Resume**

* The app allows the user to upload a resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT).
* Streamlit’s `st.file_uploader()` is used to let users select their resume.
* Example:

```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your resume", type=["pdf", "docx", "txt"])
```

---

### **Step 2: Resume Parsing**

* Once uploaded, the system **extracts text** from the resume.
* **PDFs:** Use `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` to read text.
* **DOCX:** Use `python-docx`.
* **TXT:** Simply read the text directly.
* Example:

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader(uploaded_file)
text = ""
for page in reader.pages:
    text += page.extract_text()
```

---

### **Step 3: AI Analysis**

* The extracted text is sent to an **AI model** (like OpenAI GPT) for analysis.
* The AI evaluates:

  * Grammar and spelling
  * Clarity of work experience
  * Skills relevance
  * Resume structure
  * ATS keyword optimization
* Example prompt to AI:

```python
prompt = f"Analyze this resume and provide suggestions for improvement:\n{text}"
```

---

### **Step 4: Feedback Generation**

* AI returns a structured report, which may include:

  * **Strengths:** E.g., “Your achievements are clearly quantified.”
  * **Weaknesses:** E.g., “Job descriptions could be more concise.”
  * **Suggestions:** E.g., “Add relevant keywords for Python and SQL.”
* Feedback can also be **scored** (0-100) to indicate overall resume quality.

---

### **Step 5: Display Results in Streamlit**

* Streamlit displays the results interactively:

```python
st.subheader("Resume Feedback")
st.write(ai_feedback)
st.progress(score)  # optional visual score
```

* Users can **download** the critique as PDF or CSV if implemented.

---

### **6. Optional Features**

* **Keyword Matching:** Compare resume against a job description for relevance.
* **Visual Analytics:** Charts for skill coverage using `plotly` or `matplotlib`.
* **Export Reports:** Generate PDF or Excel summary using `pandas` and `openpyxl`.

---

### **7. Why Use Streamlit?**

* **Fast UI development:** No need for HTML/CSS/JS.
* **Interactive:** Users can see instant feedback and make changes.
* **Python-native:** Works seamlessly with AI libraries like `openai`, `pandas`, `PyPDF2`.
* **Shareable:** Can be deployed as a web app easily (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku).

---

💡 **In short:**

* Streamlit handles **frontend + user interaction**.
* Python handles **resume parsing, AI communication, and report generation**.
* AI provides **intelligent suggestions** to make resumes more professional and ATS-friendly.

If you want, I can **draw a full workflow diagram** for the AI Resume Critiquer so it’s easier to visualize how everything connects. It would be perfect for a project presentation. Do you want me to do that?
