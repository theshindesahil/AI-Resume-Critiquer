Sample Resume 7.pdf,2025-11-07T07:16:04.822680,Website Developer,4,"Revise the resume to include specific projects or experiences that demonstrate your web development skills. Organize skills into categories for clarity, and ensure that the language is action-oriented. Tailor the content to include relevant keywords for ATS optimization, and consider quantifying achievements where possible.",6,5,2,4,6,5,4,5,"The objective statement is clear but could be more concise. It effectively communicates enthusiasm and a desire to learn, but lacks specific details about what the candidate can offer to the employer. Consider focusing on unique skills or experiences that set you apart.","Skills are listed but lack organization and clarity. Grouping skills into categories (e.g., Frontend Development, Programming Languages) would enhance readability. Additionally, ensure that the technologies listed are relevant to the target role of Website Developer.","There are no experience descriptions provided, which is a significant gap for a resume targeting an internship. Even if there are no formal roles, including relevant projects, coursework, or volunteer work would demonstrate practical application of skills.","The resume lacks specific tailoring for the Website Developer role. Including keywords and technologies relevant to web development, such as 'responsive design,' 'version control (Git),' or 'RESTful APIs,' would strengthen alignment with the target position.","The structure is generally clear, but the formatting could be improved. For instance, consistent use of bullet points and spacing would enhance readability. Avoid using special characters like '' which may confuse ATS parsing.","Achievements are listed but lack quantifiable metrics. For example, instead of just stating completion of courses, consider adding how these skills were applied or any projects completed as a result. This would provide more impact.","The resume currently lacks critical keywords that ATS systems look for in web development roles. Keywords such as 'JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular),' 'UI/UX design,' and 'database management (MySQL, MongoDB)' should be integrated into the skills or experience sections. For instance, add 'JavaScript frameworks' under skills and mention any relevant projects that utilized these technologies.","To improve the resume, consider adding a section for relevant projects or coursework that showcases practical application of skills. This could include personal projects, contributions to open-source, or coursework that involved web development."
