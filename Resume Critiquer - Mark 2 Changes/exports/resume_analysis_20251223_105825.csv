Sample Resume 7.pdf,2025-12-23T10:58:24.985222,,4,"Revise the resume to include specific projects or experiences that demonstrate your skills in action. Tailor the objective and skills sections with relevant keywords from job descriptions. Improve formatting for clarity and consistency, and quantify achievements where possible.",6,5,2,4,6,5,4,5,The objective statement is clear but could be more concise. It effectively communicates the candidate's enthusiasm and goals but lacks specific details about what they can offer to the company. Consider rephrasing to focus on unique skills or experiences that set you apart.,"The skills section lists relevant programming languages and technologies, but the formatting is inconsistent (e.g., 'CSS5{Bootstrap}' should be 'CSS5, Bootstrap'). Consider organizing skills into categories (e.g., 'Frontend Development', 'Programming Languages') for better clarity.","There are no work experience entries provided, which is a significant gap for an internship application. Even if there are no formal roles, consider including relevant projects, volunteer work, or academic projects that demonstrate practical application of skills.","The resume lacks specific tailoring for the IT internship role. Incorporate keywords from the job description into the objective and skills sections. For example, if the job emphasizes 'team collaboration' or 'agile methodologies', include these terms where relevant.","The overall structure is straightforward, but the layout could benefit from clearer section headings and consistent formatting. Use bullet points for skills and achievements to enhance readability. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment throughout.","Achievements are listed but lack context or metrics. For instance, instead of just stating 'Certificate of Completion', mention how the skills learned can be applied in a practical setting. Consider quantifying achievements where possible.","The resume currently lacks critical keywords that ATS systems look for in IT roles. Include terms like 'software development', 'agile', 'problem-solving', and 'collaboration'. Place these keywords in the objective and skills sections to improve ATS compatibility.","To enhance the resume, add a section for relevant projects or coursework that showcases practical application of skills. This could include personal projects, contributions to open-source, or relevant coursework that aligns with the internship role."
